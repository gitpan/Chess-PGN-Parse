Revision history for Perl extension Chess::PGN::Parse.

0.19 10-Jan-2006
    - fixed bug in recursive comment printout.
      Thanks to Dadi Jonsson for reporting it;
    - Added support for comments with newlines in between. 
      Thanks to Marcin Kasperski for the test case. 
    - Added support for promotions without the equal sign
      (e.g.: e8Q instead of e8=Q)
      Thanks to Andrew Nikitin for reporting it.
    - Tidied the code a bit.

0.18 25-May-2004
    - Broken compatibility release. 
      Perl 5.8.4 won't compile a recursive regex without
      some minor modifications. Fixed.
      If you are still using a previous version of Perl, there
      is no need to switch.

0.17 15-Jul-2003
    - Added some more control to parse irregularly formatted tags
    - Added set_{tag} methods, to set game, moves, white, black,
      site, event, eco, elos, result. 
      Such functionality is kept distinct from teh relative
      {tag} methods, to keep good performance and to avoid problems
      with existing programs.
      Thanks to Johannes Fuernkranz for feedback and advice
0.16 09-Jul-2003
    - Fixed yet another minor POD formatting problem
0.15 09-Jul-2003
    - Fixed minor POD formatting problem
0.14 08-Jul-2003
    - Added method add_comments(), to add comments to an
      already parsed game;
    - Modified bahavior of standard_PGN() so that it can use
      derived class methods for comments.
0.13 07-Jul-2003
    - Minor bug in parse_game(). {save_comments => 'no'} did
      not work as expected. Fixed.
0.12 06-Jul-2003
    - Fixed bug in standard_PGN() when printing comments.
0.11 05-Jul-2003
    - Added feature in standard_PGN(). Now it can also
      print comments
0.10 23-Dec-2002
    - Changed behavior in parse_game. Now the array in moves() is 
    always initialized and the method returns a valid array also when
    no moves are found (although it coud empty).
0.09 22-Dec-2002
    - Changed parse engine, to make it 5% faster. Thanks to [Tye]
0.08 22-Dec-2002
    - Fixed a Regex mistake, which didn't have effect on accuracy, 
      but was affecting performamce negatively. Thanks to
      Nathan Neff for the tip.
0.07 28-Mar-2002
	- a new read_game() method to support irregular input 
      1. no blank line between tags and moves;
      2. no blank line between games
      3. blank line(s) before a game (start of file)
      4. multiple tags in the same line
      5. tags spanning over more lines 
      6. No tags (only moves). 
         (can't cumulate with rule 2)
      7. semicolon comments outside the moves. 
    - The above changes make it possible to deal with
      Recursive Annotated Variations .
    - old read_game() renamed into read_standard_game()
	- modified parse_game() to support non numbered input games
	- modified standard_PGN() to output a blank line between
	  tags and game.
	- Changed dependency. IO::File instead of FileHandle.
    - added stronger structures to store comments.
	  Calling parse_game(), you can specify if the comments
	  are stored as a 'string' (default), an 'array' of strings,
	  or a 'hol', hash of lists, to identify which type of
	  comment it is (RAV, NAG, brace, semicolon, escaped).
    - fixed bug in _init(). $self->{GameErrors} was not 
      initialized after each parse.
    - fixed bug in parse_game(). FirstMove was not set correctly for
      games starting with numbers bigger than 1;
    - Added handler for the above move numbers in standard_PGN();
	- extended documentation to reflect the changes and
	  explain the module functionality.
      
0.06 16-Feb-2002
	- improved "new" method. Input can be either a string 
      or a file.
	- output to standard PGN format. Can also be customized for
	  special output such as HTML. Selection of tags for output
	  is supported.

0.05 5-Feb-2002
	- installation procedure, ready for distribution

0.04 4-Feb-2002
	- maintenance version. Small bug fixed in parse_game()

0.03 26-Jan-2002
	- remove dependency on Regexp::Common
	  (recursive RegEx extracted and integrated)
	  Twice as fast as the previous version!
	- bug fix in shrink_epd and expand_epd

0.02 24-Jan-2002
	- Parser re-written with Regular Expressions
	- use Regexp::Common to parse nested parentheses

0.01  21-Jan-2002
	- original version; 
	- Working parser. Complete but quite slow
